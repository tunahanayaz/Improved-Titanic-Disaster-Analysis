# Improved-Titanic-Disaster-Analysis

This project encompasses a comprehensive data analysis and examination of the sinking of RMS Titanic, one of the most famous maritime disasters in world history. RMS Titanic, tragically sank on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the loss of approximately 1,500 lives. This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the demographic, social, and economic data of passengers and crew members aboard the Titanic during its fateful voyage.
Data Collection and Analysis: Our project delves into a rich dataset containing various attributes of Titanic passengers such as age, gender, class, ticket fare, cabin number, and more. These data points are instrumental in helping us understand the impacts of the disaster on individuals.
Survival Rates: The project incorporates statistical analyses to compare the survival rates of passengers from different social classes, genders, and age groups. This allows us to evaluate the influence of class, gender, and age on survival.
Spatial Distribution on the Ship: The project also visually presents the distribution and accommodation of passengers and crew members within the ship. We focus on identifying which areas were the most vulnerable and the underlying reasons for this vulnerability.
This project seeks to shed light not only on the historical significance of the Titanic's sinking but also on its human repercussions. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding such events. We hope that the project's findings and analyses will contribute to future studies aimed at preventing similar disasters and enhancing the safety of societies.
